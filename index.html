    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p><strong>50501 Portland</strong> is a grassroots organizing hub rooted in Portland, Oregon. Our mission is to unify local residents, workers, and activists to confront systemic injustice, climate inaction, housing inequality, and state repression through direct action and community empowerment. We are grounded in mutual aid, collective education, and solidarity with all marginalized peoples.</p>
    <p>On <strong>May 1st, 2025</strong>, 50501 Portland led a vibrant May Day protest across the city, standing in defense of workers' rights, immigrant justice, and tenant protections. Through marches, teach-ins, art installations, and mutual aid events, we demonstrated the power of people-led resistance rooted in compassion and resolve.</p>

    <h2>About the 50501 Movement</h2>
    <p>The 50501 Movement is a nationwide grassroots initiative that began in early 2025 as a decentralized response to the policies of the Trump administration. The name stands for "50 protests, 50 states, one movement," emphasizing its goal of organizing protests across all 50 states on February 5, 2025.</p>
    <p>Building on this momentum, the national 50501 network continues to promote civic engagement through sustained protests, mutual aid events, and local organizing. The goal is to cultivate a culture of accountability, shared resistance, and long-term solidarity among grassroots movements nationwide.</p>
