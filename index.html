    <h2>About the 50501 Movement</h2>
    <p>The 50501 Movement is a nationwide grassroots initiative that began in early 2025 as a decentralized response to the policies of the Trump administration. The name stands for "50 protests, 50 states, one movement," emphasizing its goal of organizing protests across all 50 states on February 5, 2025. The movement advocates for democratic values, opposes executive overreach, and supports marginalized communities. It has organized major demonstrations, including the "Hands Off!" protests on April 5, which drew millions across the U.S. The movement continues to promote civic engagement through protests, mutual aid events, and community organizing.</p>
